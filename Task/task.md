## The Ritual Dance of Lox and Faelis

### Background

In the heart of the mystical **Forest of Lumora**, two ancient beings, the **Vira** and the **Sylph**, perform a sacred dance once every millennium. This ritual is not merely a celebration, but a powerful ceremony designed to restore and maintain the forest's delicate balance.

### Objective

Your mission is to create a simulation of the sacred dance between Vira and Sylph. Each being has its own unique set of dance moves, and when combined, these moves generate magical effects that influence the forest's environment. Your goal is to observe and determine the resulting state of the forest after the dance is completed.

### Specifications

1. **Dance Moves and Effects:**
    - Each being can perform one of three dance moves: `Twirl`, `Leap`, or `Spin`.
    - The combination of moves from both beings results in a magical effect:
        - Twirl + Twirl = Fireflies light up the forest.
        - Leap + Spin = Gentle rain starts falling.
        - Spin + Leap = A rainbow appears in the sky.
        - Other combinations create different effects that you can imagine.

2. **Dance Dynamics:**
    - Each effect will change the state of the forest.
    - Some effects can be beneficial, while others can be detrimental.

3. **Dance Sequence:**
    - The dance consists of 5 sequences.
    - You need to display the state of the forest after each sequence.
